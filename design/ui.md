# UI Design Pillars

- Simplicity (is it absolutely necessary)
- Fluid, watery, seamless
- Continuous and Predictable. Navigation and actions are obvious and produce a feeling that the user never "left" or entered a maze. Reduce "micro maze frustrations"
- High Functioning, sophisticated. Not sleezy, undercutting.
